## **Innovative Idea:** 
A basketball coach/player application linked style, that allows a user to create a profile application that shows their skills, positions they play, have clips/images of them playing and achievements they have. They can go into length about their strength as a whole and what position they want, similar to that of a job application. If they are a coach, then they can create a request for players, descirbe themselves as a coach and the team they coach for on their profile. This would be targeted towards amateur basketball players looking to find teams/players to practive/play with, and coaches who who want to scout new talent for their teams. Practice venues and events for tryouts can be hosted by coaches to scout players and they can follow players they are intrested in and see such a list on their profile.

## **Important Data/Functions:**
* Create a user profile
* Search system to find players, 
* A follow list for player/coaches, 
* Clips, media, and document support on user profiles.
* Creating session/events for scouting
* A application page for players to sign up to play for a coaches team.
