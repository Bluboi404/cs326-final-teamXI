Team Overview:
Thomas-Lombardi:Thomas Lombardi, Bluboi404: Christopher Velazquez, 
Innovative Idea: Basically its a Basketball player linkedln that allows a user to create a profile application that shows of their skills, positions they play, have clips/images or achievements they have done. They can go into length about their strengths as a whole and what position they want, similar to that of a job application. This would be targeted towards amateur basketball players looking to find teams/players to practice with, and coaches who want to scout new talent for their teams. Also coaches will be able to set up practice venues for tryouts for a team and if they like a player they can follow them on the site and keep in contact via the site as well. Coaches can also create pages for players to apply to for a position or have events to scout out talent as well.
